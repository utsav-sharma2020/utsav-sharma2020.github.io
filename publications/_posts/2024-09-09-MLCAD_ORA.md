Chip design is complex multi-step process where many new designers face steep learning curves due to limited access to high-end proprietary tools, APIs, technologies, and designs. Previous works on Large language models (LLMs) for chip design reply heavily on proprietary data. As a result, access to these models is extremely limited. Recognizing this challenge, our team set out with the task of creating an accessible, open-source assistant tailored for the physical design automation space of chip design. By leveraging the Llama3-8B foundation model and employing novel retrieval-aware fine-tuning (RAFT), we developed OpenROAD Assistantâ€”a chatbot that seamlessly responds in both natural language and Python script using the OpenROAD APIs. This strategic action has not only democratized advanced design capabilities but also yielded impressive results. Notably, OpenROAD-Assistant outperforms other foundational models such as ChatGPT3.5, ChatGPT4, Code Llama, Claude3, and other ablation study baselines on the measured metrics (pass@k for scripting and BERTScore/BARTScore for question-answering). OpenROAD-Assistant achieves a 77% pass@1 score, 80% pass@3 score for scripting, and it achieves a 98% BERTScore and 96% BARTScore on question-answering.
