Large language models (LLMs) serve as powerful tools for design, providing capabilities for both task automation and design assistance. However facilitating LLM integration into the chip design process relies on data that are not publicly available and/or not permissively licensed for use in LLM training and distribution. In this paper, we present a solution aimed at bridging this gap by introducing an open-source dataset tailored for OpenROAD, a widely adopted open-source EDA toolchain. The dataset features over 1000 data points and is structured in two formats: (i) a pairwise set comprised of question prompts with prose answers, and (ii) a pairwise set comprised of code prompts and their corresponding OpenROAD scripts. By providing this dataset, we aim to facilitate LLM-focused research within the EDA domain. The dataset is available at <a href="https://github.com/OpenROAD-Assistant/EDA-Corpus">this link </a>
