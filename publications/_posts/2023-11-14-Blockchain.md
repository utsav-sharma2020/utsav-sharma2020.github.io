The creation of state-of-the-art trusted frameworks for healthcare services that are centered around patients is necessitated by the increasing life expectancy, ease of access to healthcare, and better standards of living over the years. While conditions in the healthcare sector have been constantly improving, there are still various unresolved issues that need to be addressed. Moreover, with the evolution of technology, the existing methods of keeping records, tracking credentials, and ensuring the security of data can be made more efficient at a lower cost. One of the proposed systems is blockchain. This is an emerging field, with more and more companies using this technology to benefit practitioners in the healthcare sector, as well as patients. We perform an exploratory analysis of the use cases of Blockchain benefitting the medical sector and conclude that the application of blockchain can have a revolutionary positive impact in the field of medicine.
